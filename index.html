<p>Okay, let me back up a bit. First, there was Adam and Eve and th- You know what? Let's skip that part, plus not everyone agrees with that.</p>

<p>So, there was this friend of mine that wanted to try using APIs because he never did so (no shame! We all start from the same beginning). He wanted to write a small C# application to fetch information about a music track based on its name.<br>
A few days later, I was writing this simple application that kind of missed the point for him... But that was a way for me to learn and practice Angular 2 with TypeScript. Here we are today :-).</p>

<a id="is-it-useful" class="anchor" href="#is-it-useful" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is it useful?</h3>

<p>Well... Not very much indeed. I think of it as my very own little experimentation lab. I play with Angular2, TypeScript and I try to do so building a nice-looking web application, using purely HTML5 and CSS3 -- not even jQuery.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out or fork the code if you'd like. But as it's my learning playground, I won't accept pull request, sorry :-(.</p>
